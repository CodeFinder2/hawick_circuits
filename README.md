# Hawick circuits
Implementation of an algorithm for finding all the elementary circuits in a
directed (multi)graph. The graph can contain self-loops.

The algorithm is described
[here](http://www.massey.ac.nz/~kahawick/cstn/013/cstn-013.pdf).

The algorithm is a single header. It requires Boost 1.53.00 and later.
It was tested using the test suite [here](https://github.com/josch/cycle_test).
